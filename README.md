# Jpake-ProtocolPassword Authenticated Key Exchange by Juggling (J-PAKE) exchange.
The J-PAKE exchange is defined by Feng Hao and Peter Ryan in the paper "Password Authenticated Key Exchange by Juggling, 2008."
The J-PAKE protocol is symmetric. There is no notion of a client or server, but rather just two participants.
An instance of JPAKEParticipant represents one participant, and is the primary interface for executing the exchange.


This is an objective C implementation of Jpake with inputs from 
Java implementation of it done by bouncycastle crypto library .
